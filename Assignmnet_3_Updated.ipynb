At the outset, the necessary libraries are imported, with requests being essential for handling HTTP requests. Next, the script sets up crucial parameters for the API request, including the API key, headers, and query parameters specifying the target city, which is Seattle in this instance. Following this setup, the requests.get() function is employed to send an HTTP GET request to the designated URL, incorporating the provided headers and parameters. Upon receiving a response from the API, the script extracts the JSON-formatted data using the .json() method, storing it in the data variable. Finally, the retrieved data, representing air quality information for Seattle, is printed to the console, providing insights into the city's current air quality conditions. Through this succinct process, the script efficiently retrieves and presents pertinent air quality data using the requests library in Python."
